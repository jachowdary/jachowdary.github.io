Chowdary, IT Advisor to the Government of Andhra Pradesh, is to mobilise investments, create IT ecosystem, and provide more jobs. Mr. Chowdary says that the IT industry in India and in the U.S. will be roped in to kick-start IT initiatives in Amaravati, the proposed capital of Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Chowdary will also serve as ex-officio Secretary to the Government in the Chief Minister’s Office. His role includes advising and assisting the government in bringing in investments, generating employment, and encouraging innovation and start-up activities. It’s the time for a foolproof strategy.

So, creation of jobs, attracting investments, and securing funds for start-ups is my primary objective says Mr. Chowdary.
