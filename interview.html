				<h6><b>SHRADHA SHARMA:</b></h6>
				<p>One of the pioneers of the IT revolution in Andhra Pradesh, J A Chowdary, IT Advisor to the Government of Andhra Pradesh, is driven by mobilizing investments, creating an IT ecosystem, and providing jobs. He advises and assists the government on investments, employment, and encouraging innovation and start-up activities. In an earlier avatar, Mr. Chowdary served as Chairman of the Board of Software Technologies Parks of India (STPI), Hyderabad and Chennai.



					But most interestingly, he also gave up a secure job with the Department of Electronics just as the Indian IT boom started to take off, to become an entrepreneur – and a very successful one at that. Today, he is working on making Visakhapatnam the fintech capital of India through the Fintech Valley initiative, and create a repository of Blockchain use cases. You can find those details online easily enough.



				As a storyteller, however, it was his background and his journey that fascinated me, so that’s what we talked about. Here are excerpts from the very candid conversation with the man who rose from truly humble beginnings and is now scripting a new beginning in Andhra Pradesh.</p>

					<p ><h6><b>J A Chowdary: </h6></b> believe that while I have always enjoyed corporate success, what really helped my Hyderabad to Cyberabad transformation under the guidance of our honorable Chief Minister was that fact that lakhs of families were benefitting from the platform. That’s what made it so fulfilling. I was able to work with the Honourable Chief Minister and create a platform that is beneficial to so many people and will continue to be for several generations. He has also given different me another opportunity to create a similar platform for the Fintech Valley, the Blockchain capital in the new Andhra Pradesh.</p>
					<p>I may live for another 10-15 years, but the platform should continue forever, and many lives will be transformed. That gives me such satisfaction. In a country like ours, the employment generation engine has to be on. Otherwise, with the kind of population we have, we will have a demographic disaster on our hands if we don’t plan job opportunities for them. That’s why, again, I am very excited to work with the Honourable Chief Minister. He is encouraging us to innovate with new technologies to create new jobs for entrepreneurs in India.

				<div class="faq-toggle-inner">
					<p><h6><b>J A Chowdary:</b></h6> I was born in a very small drought-prone village called Batal Palli in Anantapur district in Andhra Pradesh. Ananta means infinite, and it was an infinitely poor district. I was born in a poor farmer’s family. We really struggled. I studied everything in Telugu medium, and there was no way I could go to a convent school. My father studied up to matriculation, but my mother never studied.



						I have seen, first-hand, the problems people in rural India face – these are the poorest of the poor. When God gives me the opportunity to do something to elevate them, I believe that is more important than making money.

						<span class="title-name"><b>Shradha:</b> So, how did you evolve into a successful entrepreneur?
						</span>
					</h3>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-toggle-inner">
					<p><h6><b>J A Chowdary:</b></h6>I don’t believe it’s my effort. It’s the blessings of my parents and the Almighty. I got into IIT-Madras for MTech. At that time, my name came in the papers because of a project I had done. I was the first person in my village to achieve this.</p>
					<p>It was when I got the meritorious Independence Day awards that I realized I could do something for development, and a lot of my inventions were picked up for BHEL. After my MTech, I got into BHEL, after which I joined the Department of Electronics (DOE) in New Delhi. In those days, it was total Licence Raj. Everybody had to come to us for import licenses, export licenses, manufacturing licenses, etc. We were so powerful; sometimes, they had to wait for hours.

					</p>
					<p>But, I wanted to do something in software. An opportunity came when I saw an internal circular announcing the setting up of a software park in Bangalore.</p>

						<span class="title-name"><b>Shradha:</b> Which year was that?
						</span>
					</h3>
				</div>

				<div class="faq-toggle-inner">
					<p><h6><b>J A Chowdary:</b></h6>This was in 1986. I was the only candidate to sign up because the others thought they had more power with the DOE Licence Raj. I thought it was a novel scheme and that I could really do something. In those days, nobody knew about the potential of software in India. When I came to Bangalore, we wanted to set up a development center. This meant we needed to have a telecom link, so we set up a satellite station on top of our Miller Road building to attach our instruments. Can you believe the satellite equipment was brought in a bullock cart? Also, we had to pay VSNL Rs 40 lakh for  64 kilobits of bandwidth. My boss, Mr. N Vittal, a very dynamic IAS officer, and whom I consider the "Father of the Indian IT industry " systematically removed all our obstacles.

					</p>
					<p>I’ll tell you an interesting story. In those days, to get any STPI license, there was a mandate that a printout of all data traffic needed to be taken. Texas Instruments had to allocate big rooms to store all these documents. An officer had to monitor what was happening 24x7. Once, during the elections, there was an incident, and IB officers came all the way from Delhi to grill the MD at Texas Instruments. I told Mr. Vittal that any information can be sent via fax machine and that there were no checks. That’s when he decided to impose restrictions on printouts and on monitoring data through the telecom line.

					</p>
					<p>At the time, none of the small companies could afford the 64kbps connection. We spoke to the erstwhile CM who told us it was not his duty to reduce costs. So, we started sharing our data at a very low cost. That brought about the real telecommunications revolution.</p>

I thought that being from Andhra Pradesh, I had to do something. There were no IT companies worth mentioning there; there was also no Internet in Hyderabad at that time.

					<p><h6><b>J A Chowdary:</b></h6>Yes, that’s a good question. One reason is Bangalore has all the public-sector companies like HAL, NAL, etc. All the tech people were already working here; the defense lab is also here. Plus, climatically, it is better!

					<p><h6><b>J A Chowdary:</b></h6>See, most MNCs don't go by the recommendations of political heads.

So many companies came, and Cunningham Road became the epicenter of India’s Silicon Valley.

					<p><h6><b>J A Chowdary:</b></h6>I started my venture in 1999. A lot of services companies used to come to me, and I used to advise them to get into products. Somehow, they saw easy money in services, and none of them listened to me, which got me a little frustrated. So, one day, I got a call from my friends in Silicon Valley who told me that they wanted to start a company, but as finances were tight, they could not open a company there.
						<p>They asked if I wanted to head the Indian operations because India was going to be critical. When I asked what they were doing, they said it had something to do with an MP3 player. That’s how the iPod happened. I was fascinated and joined without even asking what they would pay.  So, I went to Chandrababu Naidu (then CM of AP) and told him I wanted to leave the government. He asked why I wanted to leave and requested me to stay for at least another year, but I was determined to leave and join Portal Player. We rented a small house, and our boardroom was in one of the bedrooms. Whenever we had an all-hands meeting, we sat on the floor as we had no money for furniture.</p>
