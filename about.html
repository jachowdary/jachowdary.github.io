		<p class=" text-center" style="font-weight: 200; font-size: 19px;">The prime focus of J.A. Chowdary, IT Advisor to the Government of Andhra Pradesh, is to mobilise investments, create IT ecosystem, and provide more jobs. Mr. Chowdary says that the IT industry in India and in the U.S. will be roped in to kick-start IT initiatives in Amaravati, the proposed capital of Andhra Pradesh. Mr. Chowdary will also serve as ex-officio Secretary to the Government in the Chief Minister’s Office. His role includes advising and assisting the government in bringing in investments, generating employment, and encouraging innovation and start-up activities. It’s the time for a foolproof strategy. The focus is to evaluate options on how to get the companies to Amaravati and create more opportunities to the youth of the State. So, creation of jobs, attracting investments, and securing funds for start-ups is my primary objective says Mr. Chowdary.

Mr. Chowdary earlier served as Chairman of the Board of Software Technologies Parks of India (STPI), Hyderabad and Chennai. He was one of the key personalities instrumental in bringing about an IT revolution in Hyderabad. He is a well-networked IT man and also one among the trusted lieutenants of Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu.</p>
